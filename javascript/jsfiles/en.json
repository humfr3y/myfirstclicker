The rest bugs were \"Problem on a problem\" when after solving one, another appeared, btw it was the reason to fix that \"hardest\" bug. I wanted to make changing language button, and it turned out to suffer and fix that bug. Well it wasn't hard. I'm glad i finished this update and didn't abandon it. I'll be really glad if you play it at least for a little and those works, that time i spent for making update (3-7 hours per day) will not pass in vain. What about name of the game? Let me explain with small lore: You, a poor creature, aspire to become a God in virtual reality, but you need incredible power of God, which lies in the some coins that you collect during the game and then spend to get even more. Each currency makes you stronger and more powerful. However will everything will be simple? Will Fortune help this time?",

Then came the another horror - importing - I couldn't figure out how to save an array of achievement completions ([true, false, false, ...]), so I simply combined both base64 strings and split them during import. And then came the true worst nightmare - Offline Progress. I must have spent around 15 hours in total on it, constantly finding loopholes in this fragile paper ship that is barely holding together even now.
